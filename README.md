# Eyevinn WebPlayer
The Eyevinn WebPlayer is a simplistic video (audio is on the roadmap) player for playback of ABR streams. It is free-to-use and currently supports the ABR streaming formats Apple HLS, MPEG-DASH and Microsoft Smooth Streaming.
The player is built using a modular approach which means that each module is available as separate packages, we also provide a player module that bundles it all together in a neat package.

Demo: TODO... 

## Development
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
